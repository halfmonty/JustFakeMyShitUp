          <h4 class="card-title">Why?</h4>
          <p class="card-text">Something is very unsettling in this day and age how often a screenshot of a conversation
            becomes used as evidence to make statements about someone's character while obvious faked conversations are 
            used for internet points on various sites across the net. Far far too many people just take for granted a 
            screenshot of a conversation as truth without giving it a second thought. Now there are a number of ways
            to fake conversations but this is just to make the process super simple to generate fairly convincing fakes.
            <br/><br/>
            Like common knoweledge of photoshop has helped less people be fooled by pictures of the absurd, improbable or
            impossible, that is the aim of this tool, to make fake conversation screenshots incredibly common knoweledge
            so people will be skeptical and not so quickly accept things that are easily faked.
